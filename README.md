# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python

These are examples of Classic Data Structures and Algorithms for Python
I am going to go through courses and examples and create folders for each
Below should be the listed Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary Search Trees
 - Balanced Binary Trees (AVL Trees)
 - Balanced Binary Trees (Red-Black Trees)
- Heaps
- Associative Arrays/Dictionaries
- Tries

Algorithms
- Basic Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Graphing Algorithms
